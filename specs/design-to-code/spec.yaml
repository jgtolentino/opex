problem:
  summary: >
    Converting Figma designs or live website layouts into production-ready,
    editable code requires significant manual effort, slows prototyping,
    creates mismatched design systems, and introduces handoff friction between
    design and development teams.

context:
  audience:
    - Designers
    - Front-end engineers
    - Founders
    - AI developer tooling teams
  affected-systems:
    - Claude Code CLI
    - VS Code extension
    - Figma plugin ecosystem
    - Web playground runtime

goals:
  - Convert Figma designs into code (React, TSX, UI libraries).
  - Clone and translate any public live URL into an editable codebase.
  - Provide a real-time tri-panel workspace (Code, Preview, Reference).
  - Auto-detect UI components and generate reusable structures.
  - Allow customization of tokens, frameworks, file structure, and naming.

non-goals:
  - Backend code generation or API scaffolding.
  - Full automatic state management inference.
  - Design system governance or auditing features.

constraints:
  - Must integrate cleanly with Claude Code without requiring heavy external infra.
  - Figma access must respect OAuth scopes and team/project permissions.
  - Website cloning must display clear legal/IP responsibility notices.
  - Generated projects must build with a standard Node.js toolchain (e.g. pnpm, npm, or yarn).

dependencies:
  - Figma REST and Node Tree APIs.
  - Claude Code SDK / hooks.
  - Browser DOM + CSS extractor for URL inputs.
  - VS Code extension APIs (Webview, filesystem access).
  - Local preview runtime (Next.js or Vite).

acceptance-criteria:
  - A selected Figma frame imports and generates valid TSX with optional UI-library bindings.
  - A public URL imports with layout, CSS, and key assets preserved.
  - Generated code builds locally without syntax errors using the recommended tooling.
  - Visually identical elements are extracted into reusable components with >70% accuracy.
  - Users can export a working project folder and run `dev` locally to see the cloned UI.

metrics:
  - p95 generation time under 5 seconds for a single-screen import.
  - Component reuse accuracy target of at least 70%.
  - Visual fidelity target of at least 90% similarity to the source design.
  - 100% build success rate for freshly exported projects.

risks:
  - Legal/IP exposure when cloning proprietary websites without rights.
  - Layout inference inconsistencies on complex, responsive designs.
  - LLM hallucinations causing invalid markup or unused code.

mitigations:
  - Mandatory user confirmation and IP notice on URL-based imports.
  - Deterministic fallback mapping for layout (flex/grid) and typography.
  - Component-matching model with user override controls for edge cases.
  - CI tests that run lint + build on a suite of reference Figma files and URLs.

milestones:
  - m1: Playground runtime (tri-panel UI + basic preview).
  - m2: Figma importer and node tree normalization.
  - m3: URL importer with DOM/CSS extraction.
  - m4: UI-library adapters (ShadCN, MUI, AntD, no-library mode).
  - m5: VS Code + Claude Code integration and packaging.
